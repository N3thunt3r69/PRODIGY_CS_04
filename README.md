# PRODIGY_CS_04
This is basic keylogger program that records and logs keystrokes in a file named "keystrokes". The focus is on logging the keys pressed and saving them to a file with the name of the program running at that time and the timestamp too. This program was created with ethicality as the focus.

I'll work on an updated version of this later where the logs can be accessed remotely via a locally hosted ssh server.
